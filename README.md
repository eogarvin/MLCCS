<h2 align="center">🪐 MLCCS 🪐</h2>

This public repository shares the MLCCS codes from the research paper: 

**E. O. Garvin et al. (in prep):** "Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection in High-Contrast Spectroscopy: Revealing Exoplanets by Leveraging Hidden Molecular Signatures in
Cross-Correlated Spectra with Convolutional Neural Networks." (Submitted at A&A).

**MLCCS** is a Python codebase to apply _**M**achine **L**earning on **C**ross-**C**orrelation for **S**pectroscopy_ , to detect exoplanets by using molecular templates, or to search for molecules on exoplanets with extra sensitivity. 


## 💻 Installation

The code is organized as a Python package, and can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eogarvin/MLCCS.git
cd MLCCS
pip install .
```

## 📒 The codes we used

- We made use of petitRADTRANS to prepare the data and templates:

- We borrowed and adapted the cross-correlation function (crosscorrRV) codes from PyAstronomy
