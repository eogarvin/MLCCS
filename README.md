<h2 align="center">🪐 MLCCS 🪐</h2>

This public repository shares the MLCCS codes from the research paper: 

**E. O. Garvin et al. (in prep):** "Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection in High-Contrast Spectroscopy: Revealing Exoplanets by Leveraging Hidden Molecular Signatures in
Cross-Correlated Spectra with Convolutional Neural Networks." (Submitted at A&A).

**MLCCS** is a Python codebase to apply _**M**achine **L**earning on **C**ross-**C**orrelation for **S**pectroscopy_ , to detect exoplanets by using molecular templates, or to search for molecules on exoplanets with extra sensitivity. 


## Installation

The code is organized as a Python package, and can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eogarvin/MLCCS.git
cd MLCCS
pip install .
```

## 📚 Documentation

Documentation is not yet available for this code, but the code has many comments the users can rely on. 

## Authors and implementation of the codes

All codes have been written by Emily Omaya Garvin, with additional contributions from Markus Bonse. The codes have been successfully installed, investigated and tested by Jonas Spiller.
